    <h2>Comparing String Equality</h2>
    <p>String = “” creates a string literal. String literals are stored in the string constant pool. We can test their equality with “==” operator.</p>

    <p>String = new String(“”) create a string object in the heap. We cannot test their equality with the “==” operator, because it is actually comparing the address of those two string objects. We should use String.equals() instead.</p>
