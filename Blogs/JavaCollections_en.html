    <h2>Java Collections</h2>
    <p>You may have used ArrayList to solve coding problems. In fact, Java has provided many collection classes that are essential for developers. Let’s take a look!</p>
    <img src="../Pictures/Collection Heirarchy.png">
    <p>That’s a lot of collection classes! But don’t worry. We’ll look at each one of them. And by the end of the tutorial, you’ll feel more familiar with them.</p>
    <h3>Collections and Map</h3>  
    <p>There are 2 fundamental interfaces in Java Collections: Collections and Map. Collections are for single value lists/sets. Maps are for key-value pairs.</p>
    <p>We often write code like this:</p>
    <p>List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();</p>
    <p>The code above created a new ArrayList Object and assigned that to a List variable. This is because if we change our mind, we can assign a different implementation of List later.</p>
    <p>Because Collection is the interface for all its subclasses, we could use call it’s methods from all of its subclasses. Here are some common ones:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="background-color: lightblue">methods</th>
            <th style="background-color: lightblue">Descriptions</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public boolean add(E e)</td>
            <td>Adds an element to this collection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public void clear()</td>
            <td>Removes all elements from this collection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public boolean remove(E e)</td>
            <td>Removes an element from this collection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public boolean contains(Object obj)</td>
            <td>Returns true if this collection contains the specified element</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public boolean isEmpty()</td>
            <td>Returns true if this collection contains no elements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public int size()</td>
            <td>Returns the number of elements in this collection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>public Object[] toArray()</td>
            <td>Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
